We explore novel stochastic approaches capable of predicting accurately experimental measurements such as the Breakdown Probability, and the jitter. Additionally, the SPAD avalanche dynamics that is a stochastic process, is discussed within a transient Monte Carlo simulation perspective. We also derived a VerilogA model, making possible the analysis of the stochastic responses of the SPAD, including the buildup of the avalanche but also its quench. This latter quench probability of these diodes once in avalanche, rarely discussed in literature, is related to the dynamics of the voltage change of the floating cathode node. If the cathode voltage recovery (after the debiasing due to the quench circuit) is quicker than the time needed for the carrier evacuation within the avalanche junction, small additional avalanches can occur.","tags":[],"title":"Multiscale SPAD modeling: from Monte Carlo to SPICE simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rémi Helleboid","Jerome Saint-Martin","Marco Pala","Philippe Dollfus","Denis Rideau","Gabriel Mugny","Isobel Nicholson","Jeremy Grebot"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691593902,"objectID":"d9c6cfde89fba4621b12b03c15ac8840","permalink":"https://remihelleboid.github.io/publication/helleboid-automatic-2023/","publishdate":"2023-08-09T15:11:41.903672Z","relpermalink":"/publication/helleboid-automatic-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"A method to efficiently optimize doping profile for high performance Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes is presented.

Carrier transport is simulated in the real space using a particle Monte Carlo approach based on the Fokker-Planck point of view on an advection-diffusion equation, that enables us to reproduce mobility models, including electric ﬁelds and doping dependencies. The avalanche process is computed thanks to impact ionization rates implemented using a modiﬁed Random Path Length algorithm. Both transport and impact ionization mechanisms are computed concurrently from a statistical point of view, which allows us to achieve a full multi-particle simulation. This method provides accurate simulation of transport and avalanche process suitable for realistic three-dimensional SPADs, including all relevant stochastic aspects of these devices, together with a huge reduction of the computational time required, compared to standard Monte Carlo methods for charge carrier transport. The efﬁciency of our method empowers the possibility to precisely evaluate SPADs ﬁgures of merit and to explore new features that were untrackable by conventional methods. An extensive series of comparisons with experimental data on state-of-the art SPADs shows a very good accuracy of the proposed approach.","tags":[],"title":"A Fokker-Planck-based Monte Carlo method for electronic transport and avalanche simulation in single-photon avalanche diodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dorian Saint-Pierre","Raphaël Clerc","Rémi Helleboid","Denis Rideau"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691593902,"objectID":"d24993c969ff3754caf81c4fba558917","permalink":"https://remihelleboid.github.io/publication/saint-pierre-convergence-2022/","publishdate":"2023-08-09T15:11:42.037663Z","relpermalink":"/publication/saint-pierre-convergence-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"McIntyre's local and non-local equations are used to calculate the avalanche triggering probability, useful in the modeling of Dark Count Rates and Probability Detection Efficiency of Single Photon Avalanche Detectors (SPAD).

Today, most of SPADs in the Time Of Flight (TOF) market are composed of a micrometric Silicon PN junction associated to a proximity CMOS electronics biasing the system above the breakdown voltage. These devices present low noise, high pixel-matrix integration capabilities, but their Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) is relatively modest in the near infrared operating region (achieving typically only few percent at a wavelength of 940 nm). A considerable optimisation of the SPAD design is currently on going at an industrial level with a view of increasing the PDE without compromising the timing statistic response to avalanche (Jitter) and its quench probability. Within these perspectives, standard commercial Technology-Computer-Assisted-Design (TCAD) simulations can only provide a limited guidance for technological and design splits optimisation since they are based on deterministic solvers that are unable to capture these stochastic figures of merit. Since the seminal work from Spinelli [1] clearly showing that Monte Carlo simulations predictions can compare favourably with experimental measurements of PDE and timing resolution, the Monte Carlo method can be considered to be a useful one for the design of improved structures. It has been recently applied to optimize the PDE and Jitter of Silicon [3] and InGaAs SPADs [4],[5]. In this abstract we report a rigorous comparison between Monte Carlo predictions and measurements of PDE and Jitter. We also discuss in detail, the quench probability of these diodes once in avalanche. This latter point has rarely been discussed in literature and to the best of our knowledge never addressed within a Monte Carlo perspective.","tags":["Distance measurement","Jitter","Monte Carlo methods","Semiconductor device measurement","Semiconductor process modeling","Silicon","Timing"],"title":"Single Photon Avalanche Diode with Monte Carlo Simulations: PDE, Jitter and Quench Probability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thibauld Cazimajou","Marco Pala","Jérôme Saint-Martin","Rémi Helleboid","Jérémy Grebot","Denis Rideau","Philippe Dollfus"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660170568,"objectID":"e1bafe8874a9134f2104038691344f9e","permalink":"https://remihelleboid.github.io/publication/cazimajou-quenching-2021/","publishdate":"2022-08-10T22:29:28.792911Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cazimajou-quenching-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The statistical behavior of silicon-based single-photon-avalanche-diodes (SPADs) is investigated by using self-consistent 3-D Monte Carlo simulations.
