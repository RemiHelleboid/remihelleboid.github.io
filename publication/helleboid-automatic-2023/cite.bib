 abstract = {A method to efficiently optimize doping profile for high performance Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes is presented. The method aims at maximizing the photon detection efficiency while minimizing the timing jitter and keeping the breakdown voltage in a reasonable range by optimizing the doping profile of the device. Two different optimization methods are compared, and their performances are evaluated on a one-dimensional model of a Si-SPAD.},
