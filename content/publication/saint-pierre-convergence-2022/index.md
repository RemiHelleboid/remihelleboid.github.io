abstract: McIntyre's local and non-local equations are used to calculate the avalanche
  triggering probability, useful in the modeling of Dark Count Rates and Probability
  Detection Efficiency of Single Photon Avalanche Detectors (SPAD). Although non-linear,
  the local equations have a closed-form solution, while the more rigorous non-local
  history-dependent equations can be solved only by an iterative approach. However,
  the convergence of the latest approach is fairly slow, making the modeling of SPAD
  properties relatively time consuming. An alternative and numerically efficient method
  is proposed to solve the local equations, avoiding the use of the closed-form solution
  and its time-consuming root finding step. Several approaches are then discussed
  to improve the convergence of the non-local history-dependent equations.
