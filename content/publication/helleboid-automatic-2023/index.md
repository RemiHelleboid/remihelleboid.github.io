abstract: A method to efficiently optimize doping profile for high performance Single-Photon
  Avalanche Diodes is presented. The method aims at maximizing the photon detection
  efficiency while minimizing the timing jitter and keeping the breakdown voltage
  in a reasonable range by optimizing the doping profile of the device. Two different
  optimization methods are compared, and their performances are evaluated on a one-dimensional
  model of a Si-SPAD.
