abstract: We present a study of the main SPAD figures of merit using a multiscale
  approach, from Monte Carlo simulations to SPICE simulations. We explore novel stochastic
  approaches capable of predicting accurately experimental measurements such as the
  Breakdown Probability, and the jitter. Additionally, the SPAD avalanche dynamics
  that is a stochastic process, is discussed within a transient Monte Carlo simulation
  perspective. We also derived a VerilogA model, making possible the analysis of the
  stochastic responses of the SPAD, including the buildup of the avalanche but also
  its quench. This latter quench probability of these diodes once in avalanche, rarely
  discussed in literature, is related to the dynamics of the voltage change of the
  floating cathode node. If the cathode voltage recovery (after the debiasing due
  to the quench circuit) is quicker than the time needed for the carrier evacuation
  within the avalanche junction, small additional avalanches can occur.
