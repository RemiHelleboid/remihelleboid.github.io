abstract: We present an efﬁcient simulation method for electronic transport and avalanche
  in single-photon avalanche diodes (SPAD). Carrier transport is simulated in the
  real space using a particle Monte Carlo approach based on the Fokker-Planck point
  of view on an advection-diffusion equation, that enables us to reproduce mobility
  models, including electric ﬁelds and doping dependencies. The avalanche process
  is computed thanks to impact ionization rates implemented using a modiﬁed Random
  Path Length algorithm. Both transport and impact ionization mechanisms are computed
  concurrently from a statistical point of view, which allows us to achieve a full
  multi-particle simulation. This method provides accurate simulation of transport
  and avalanche process suitable for realistic three-dimensional SPADs, including
  all relevant stochastic aspects of these devices, together with a huge reduction
  of the computational time required, compared to standard Monte Carlo methods for
  charge carrier transport. The efﬁciency of our method empowers the possibility to
  precisely evaluate SPADs ﬁgures of merit and to explore new features that were untrackable
  by conventional methods. An extensive series of comparisons with experimental data
  on state-of-the art SPADs shows a very good accuracy of the proposed approach.
