abstract: Dark Count Rate (DCR) in 3D-stacked CMOS Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD)
  is investigated by means of measurements and simulations at various temperatures
  and voltages. This study strengthens previous hypotheses on the roles of depleted
  regions and interfaces in DCR generation by examining device architectures. A nonradiative
  multiphonon-assisted trapping model (NRM) is used to calculate the carrier capture/emission
  rate of defect sites. Systematic comparison between measurement and Empirical Monte-Carlo
  (EMC) simulation, accounting for the stochastic diffusion of carriers in computation
  of the avalanche breakdown probability (Pt), was performed to investigate trap and
  avalanche positions within the device. This simulation unveils device regions contributing
  to different DCR dynamics by de-embedding carrier avalanche localizations. Based
  on this simulation methodology, the DCR statistical distribution induced by local
  device-to-device process variation is covered by randomly setting the defect positions
  and sizes within the device.
